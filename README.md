# Episode 5: Real-Time Room Updates and User Interactions

In this episode, we focused on implementing real-time features for room updates and user interactions within a system. Key enhancements include:

## Features
```
- **Real-time Room Updates**: Users can now be added to rooms dynamically, and the updates are immediately reflected in the UI using Turbo Streams.
- **Turbo Stream Integration**: We leveraged Turbo Streams to provide live updates on the rooms, without requiring page reloads, improving the user experience.
- **Sidebar Enhancements**: The sidebar now shows the user's rooms in real-time, with the ability to interact and manage them.
- **Room and User Associations**: We created a robust association between users and rooms, ensuring that changes in the backend trigger immediate UI updates.
```
## What's Next

In the next episode, we will dive into handling messages within the system, enabling users to communicate in real-time within the rooms.
